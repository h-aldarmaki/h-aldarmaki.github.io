<div style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">

I am an assistant professor in the NLP department at Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI). My research broadly covers speech and language technologies, including speech recognition and synthesis, speech privacy, Arabic speech and language processing, clinical speech processing for speech-language pathology, and multimodal language understanding, including sign language. Generally speaking, I am interested in exploring accessible and inclusive real-world applications of speech/language technologies. I also often find myself curious about overly specific research questions  that have almost no practical consequences. I value curiosity, rigor, integrity, and responsibility. Creativity and productivity are also nice. 

Besides research, I am interested in teaching and learning. I serve in the MBZUAI Center for Teaching and Learning where I explore ways to improve learning outcomes and think about the future of education. In my spare time, I paint (or agonize about it). <br><br>

<strong>Contact:</strong> You can contact me if you're interested in discussions and research collaborations, especially if (1) you are actively working on a related research project or (2) have a compelling research proposal. I may have openings for post-doc positions or research visits if you have relevant skills and experience (see my Projects page).
