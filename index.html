Hello! Welcome to my homepage, where I showcase the work done with my research group at MBZUAI et al. 
You will also find some posts and tutorials covering topics related to speech and language processing and other topics. 
I’ll try my best to offer rigorous and well-researched pieces. 
If you find flaws or misguided claims, kindly let me know. In the meantime, here is an inspirational quote for you:
